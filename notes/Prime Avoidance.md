# Prime Avoidance Lemma

Let $I_{1}\cdots I_{j}, J$ be ideals of a ring $R$. If $J \subset \bigcup_{j}I_{j}$  (contained, but not necessarily a specific one yet) then
- $R$ contains an infinite field *or* at most $2$ of the $I_{j}$ are not prime ideals,
- then $J$ $\subset$ $I_{j}$ for some $j$.

If $R$ is a [[Graded Ring]], and $J$ is generated by homogeneous elements of degree $>0$, 
- then all $I_{j}$ are prime ideals
- only the homogeneous elements of $J$ are contained in the union of $I_{j}$

**Prime Avoidance** comes from the idea that if an ideal $I$ is not contained in any of the finite number of primes $P_{j}$, then there is an element of $I$ that *avoids* being contained in any of the $P_{j}$. 

#### Proof:
If $R$ contains an infinite field (literally a field with infinite elements):
- No vector space $(J)$ over an infinite field can be a finite union of proper subspaces
- $J$ cannot be contained in a finite union (and thus must be contained in one)

$R$ does not contain an infinite field. Induction on $n$, the number of ideals $I_{1}\cdots I_{n}$. For $n=1$, trivially, $J \subseteq I_1$. 

Now, assume
$$\begin{aligned}
J & \subseteq I_{1} \cup I_{2} \cup \cdots \cup I_{n} \\
J & \not\subseteq I_{j} \text{ for j} = 1, 2 \cdots, n \\
\end{aligned}$$
For each $k$, as $J \not\subseteq I_{k}$, there exists some $x_{k}\in I$ where $x_{k}\not \in I_{k}$. Suppose $n = 2$. We know $x_{1}+ x_{2}$ is not in $I_{1}$ nor $I_{2}$ as both prime ideals are missing at least one of the elements. This is a contradiction.

For $n > 2$, construct $x$ as
$$x = x_{1} + x_{2}x_{3}\cdots x_{n}$$
such that $x, x_1 \in J$. Upon inspection, $x_{1}\not \in I_{1}$ so $x \not \in I_{1}$. For every $I_{k}$, $x \not\in I_{k}$ since the product $x_{2}\cdots x_{n}$ is not in $I_{k}$ as there is some $x_{k} \not \in I_{k}$. Thus, $x \not \in I_{k}$.

So, as $x \in J$, $x \not \in \bigcup_{i}^{n}I_{i}$, this is a contradiction.

TO BE FILLED

## Consequences
By [[Associated Prime#Theorem 3.1|Theorem 3.1]], if $M$ in nonzero, then the [[Associated Prime|associated primes]] $\text{Ass}M$ is non empty. 

# Proposition 3.4 - Maximal Annihilators are Prime
Let $R$ be a ring, and $M$ an $R-$module. If $I$ is an ideal of $R$ maximal among all ideals of $R$ that are annihilators of elements of $M$, then $I$ is prime (and thus in $\text{Ass}M$). 
- In a sense, its maximality provides some prime-like qualities, that make it actually prime.  
- In particular, if $M$ is a [[Noetherian Ring]], then $\text{Ass}M$ is nonempty by [[Associated Prime#Theorem 3.1|Theorem 3.1]]. 
#### Proof:
If $rs \in I$ and $s \not\in I$, then we must show that $r \in I$. If $m \in M$ is an element with 
$$\text{ann}(m) = I$$
then $rsm = 0$ but $sm \neq 0$ by definition of annihilators. Thus $(r, I)$ is contained in the annihilator of $sm$, and since $I$ was maximal, $(r) + I = I$, so $r \in I$.

# Corollary 3.5 - Localization and Injectivity
Suppose that $M,N$ are modules over a [[Noetherian Ring]] $R$. 
1. (Localize at Maximal Associated Prime) If $0 = m \in M \iff$ $m$ becomes $0$ in after localization in $M_P$ for each maximal [[Associated Prime|associated primes]] of $M$. 
2. (All Associated Primes are Zero) For submodule $K \subset M$, $K = 0 \iff K_{P}= 0, \forall P \in \text{Ass}M$.
3. (Injectivity) A [[Morphisms#Homomorphism|homomorphism]] $\phi : M \to N$ is a monomorphism (injective) $\iff$ the localization $\phi_{P}: M_{P}\to N_{P}$ is a [[Morphisms#Monomorphism|monomorphism]] for each [[Associated Prime|associated prime]] $P$ of $M$. 
Proof.
1. Suppose $m \neq 0$, where $m \in M$. Since $R$ is a [[Noetherian Ring]], there is a prime maximal ideal among the annihilators of elements of $M$ that contain $\text{Ann}(m)$ and this prime is an [[Associated Prime|associated prime]] of $M$ by [[Prime Avoidance#Proposition 3.4|Proposition 3.4]]. Thus $\text{Ann}(m)$ is contained in a maximal associated prime $P$ so $m / 1 \neq 0$ in $M_{P}$. 
2. If $K = 0$ then clearly $K_{P}= 0$ for all $P$.  All $k \in K$ is $0 / k\in K_{P}$ . If $K \neq 0$, we can choose some $0 \neq m \in K$ and apply part $1.$ 
3. By Proposition 2.5, $(\text{ker}\phi)_{P}= \text{ker}(\phi_{P})$. The result follows by putting $K = \text{ker}\phi$ in part $2.$

# Lemma 3.6 - Support of a Module
1. If $M = M' \oplus M''$, then $\text{Ass} M = (\text{Ass} M') \cup (\text{Ass} M'')$. 
2. $0 \to M' \to M \to M'' \to 0$ is a [[Exact Sequence|short exact sequence]] of $R-$modules, then 
$$\text{Ass}M' \subset \text{Ass}M \subset (\text{Ass} M') \cup (\text{Ass} M'')$$
