A field $k$, is **algebraically closed** if for every polynomial with its coefficients in $k$, there exists at root for that polynomial. 

## Example

The field $\mathbb{C}$ is **algebraically closed**. Although I will not prove it here, suppose $f(x)  = x^2 + 1$. The roots of $f$ are:
$$0 = x^2 + 1 \implies x = \pm i$$
