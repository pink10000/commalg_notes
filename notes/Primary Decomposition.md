# Primary 
A submodule $N$ of a module $M$ is **primary** if $\text{Ass}(M/N)$ consists of just one prime. If $\text{Ass}(M / N) = \{P\}$, we say that $N$ is $P-$primary.

# Coprimary
Since the condition is dependent on $M/N$, we say that a module $M$ is **coprimary** if $0$ is a primary submodule, that is $\text{Ass}(M)$ consists of just one prime ideal.
