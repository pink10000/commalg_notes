A **complex** of modules is a sequence of modules and maps between them:
$$
\mathcal{C}: \cdots \to A \to_{f} B \to_{g} \cdots
$$
such that the composition $gf$ of any two consecutive maps is $0$. Many of the operations that apply to modules, such as $\otimes$ and $\text{Hom}$, can also be applied to complexes of modules.

## Homology
The **homology** of the complex $\mathcal{C}$ at the module $B$ is 
$$\text{ker}(g)/\text{im}(f)$$
