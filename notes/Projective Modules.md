An $R-$module $P$ is called **projective** iff it is a direct summand of a [[Free Module]], $R^{n}$.
$$P \oplus Q \cong R^{n}$$
where we say that $Q$ exists

# Corollary - Local Rings
If $R$ is a [[Local Ring]], finitely generated $M$ is **projective** iff [[Free Module|Free]]. This follows from [[Nakayama's Lemma]] and being in a [[Exact Sequence#Short Exact Sequence|short exact sequence]]. 

^^ TO BE PROVED LATER 


# Projective Dimension
$$\text{pd}(M) = \inf\{n \;|\; 0 \to P_{n}\to \cdots P_{0}\to M \to 0\}$$
where it is defined over an [[Exact Sequence]], called a Resolution. 

# Free Resolutions
For an $R$-module $M$,
