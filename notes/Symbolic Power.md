# Symbolic Powers
If $P$ is a maximal ideal of ring $R$ and $I$ is any proper ideal containing a power of $P$, then $I$ is $P-$[[Primary Decomposition|primary]].
- For in the case $P$ is the only prime containing the annihilator $I$ of $R/I$, [[Associated Prime#Theorem 3.1|Theorem 3.1]] shows that $\text{Ass}R / I = \{P\}$.
- This generalizes the fact that any power of a prime in the integers is [[Primary Decomposition#Primary|primary]].

In general, the $P-$primary component of the $n$th power of $P$ is called the $n$th **symbolic power** of $P$, and is written 
$$P^{(n)}$$
In the general case, the symbolic powers of $P$ have a nice geometric description as follows, due to Zariski and Nagata.
