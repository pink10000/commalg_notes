Morphisms are **maps** between algebraic structures that define their behavior.


# Homomorphism
For modules $M,N$ a homomorphism
$$\phi : M \to N$$
satisfies
$$\phi(m_{1}+ m_{2}) = \phi(m_{1}) + \phi(m_{2})$$
$$\phi(r \cdot m) = r \cdot \phi(m)$$
for any $r \in R$.

# Monomorphism
An injective monomorphism.
$$\phi(m_{1}) = \phi(m_{2)}\implies m_{1}= m_{2}$$
# Epimorphism
A surjective homomorphism.

# Isomorphism
A bijective homomorphism. 

# Automorphism
A isomorphism from itself to itself.
