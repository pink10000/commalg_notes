Let $I_{1}\cdots I_{j}, J$ be ideals of a ring $R$. Then, 
- If $J \subset \bigcup_{j}I_{j}$  (contained, but not necessarily a specific one)
- $R$ contains an infinite field *or* at most $2$ of the $I_{j}$ are not prime ideals,
- then $J$ is actually contained in one of the $I_{j}$. 

If $R$ is a [[Graded Ring]], and $J$ is generated by homogeneous elements of degree $>0$, 
- then all $I_{j}$ are prime ideals
- only the homogeneous elements of $J$ are contained in the union of $I_{j}$

**Prime Avoidance** comes from the idea that if an ideal $I$ is not contained in any of the finite number of primes $P_{j}$, then there is an element of $I$ that *avoids* being contained in any of the $P_{j}$. 

# Proof
If $R$ contains an infinite field (literally a field with infinite elements):
- No vector space $(J)$ over an infinite field can be a finite union of proper subspaces
- $J$ cannot be contained in a finite union (and thus must be contained in one)

$R$ does not contain an infinite field. Induction on $n$, the number of ideals $I_{1}\cdots I_{n}$
- $n = 1$: Trivially, $J \subseteq I_1$
- Suppose it holds for fewer than $n$ ideals. We need to show it holds for $n$ ideals.

Assume $J \subseteq \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} I_{i}$ and that $J$ is not contained in any smaller union of ideals. Or,
$$J \not\subset \bigcup_{i \neq k} I_{i}$$ for any $k$, such that $J \subseteq I_{k}$

By this, we can find some $x_{i}\in J$ where $x_{i}\not\in \bigcup_{j \neq i}I_{j}$ but as $J$ is not contained, $x_{i}\in I_{i}$ (sets up premise for containment).

For $n=2$, we consider $x_{1} + x_{2} \in J$, but not in either $I_{1}$ or $I_{2}$. This is a contradiction by the supposition that $J \subseteq I_{1}\cup I_{2}$. 

For $n > 2$, we can assume $I_{1}$ to be prime (see definition, point 2) and $x_{1}+ x_{2}x_{3} \cdots$ is not in any of the $I_{j}$ and a contradiction.

# Proposition 3.4 - Maximal Annihilators are Prime
Let $R$ be a ring, and $M$ an $R-$module. If $I$ is a maximal ideal of all annihilator ideals of elements of $M$ in $R$, then $I$ is prime (and thus in $\text{Ass}M$). 
- In a sense, its maximality provides some prime-like qualities, that make it actually prime.  
- In particular, if $M$ is a [[Noetherian Ring]], then $\text{Ass}M$ is nonempty by [[Associated Prime#Theorem 3.1|Theorem 3.1]]. 
# Corollary 3.5 - Localization and Injectivity
Suppose that $M,N$ are modules over a [[Noetherian Ring]] $R$. 
1. (Localize at Maximal Associated Prime) If $0 = m \in M \iff$ $m$ becomes $0$ in after localization in $M_P$ for each maximal [[Associated Prime|associated primes]] of $M$. 
2. (All Associated Primes are Zero) For submodule $K \subset M$, $K = 0 \iff K_{P}= 0, \forall P \in \text{Ass}M$.
3. (Injectivity) A [[Morphisms#Homomorphism|homomorphism]] $\phi : M \to N$ is a monomorphism (injective) $\iff$ the localization $\phi_{P}: M_{P}\to N_{P}$ is a [[Morphisms#Monomorphism|monomorphism]] for each [[Associated Prime|associated prime]] $P$ of $M$. 
Proof.
1. Suppose $m \neq 0$, where $m \in M$. Since $R$ is a [[Noetherian Ring]], there is a prime maximal ideal among the annihilators of elements of $M$ that contain $\text{Ann}(m)$ and this prime is an [[Associated Prime|associated prime]] of $M$ by [[Prime Avoidance#Proposition 3.4|Proposition 3.4]]. Thus $\text{Ann}(m)$ is contained in a maximal associated prime $P$ so $m / 1 \neq 0$ in $M_{P}$. 
2. If $K = 0$ then clearly $K_{P}= 0$ for all $P$.  All $k \in K$ is $0 / k\in K_{P}$ . If $K \neq 0$, we can choose some $0 \neq m \in K$ and apply part $1.$ 
3. By Proposition 2.5, $(\text{ker}\phi)_{P}= \text{ker}(\phi_{P})$. The result follows by putting $K = \text{ker}\phi$ in part $2.$

# Lemma 3.6 - Support of a Module
1. If $M = M' \oplus M''$, then $\text{Ass} M = (\text{Ass} M') \cup (\text{Ass} M'')$. 
2. $0 \to M' \to M \to M'' \to 0$ is a [[Exact Sequence|short exact sequence]] of $R-$modules, then 
$$\text{Ass}M' \subset \text{Ass}M \subset (\text{Ass} M') \cup (\text{Ass} M'')$$
